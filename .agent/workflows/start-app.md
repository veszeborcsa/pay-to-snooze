## Post-Implementation: Start the App

After completing any new feature, bug fix, or implementation change, always start the app to verify it runs correctly.

// turbo
1. Start the Expo development server:
```
npx expo start --web
```

Run this from the project root: `c:\Users\User\Documents\projektek\pay-to-snooze`

> **Note**: This workflow should be triggered automatically after every implementation task is completed.
